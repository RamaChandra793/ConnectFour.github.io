  <p> <h2>Here are the basic rules to play Connect Four:</h2></p>

  <p>1. Objective: The objective of Connect Four is to be the first player to connect four of your colored discs in a row, column, or diagonal.</p>
    
  <p>2. Game Setup: The game is played on a vertical grid with 6 rows and 7 columns. Each player chooses a color (usually red or yellow) to represent their discs.</p>
    
  <p>3. Starting the Game: The game begins with an empty grid. Player 1 (usually represented by red discs) goes first.</p>
    
  <p>4. Taking Turns: Players take turns dropping one of their colored discs into any column of the grid. The disc falls to the lowest available empty space in the chosen column.</p>
    
  <p> 5. Winning the Game: The game continues until one player connects four of their discs in a row, column, or diagonal. The winning player must have four consecutive discs of their color either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.</p>
    
  <p> 6. End of the Game: If the entire grid is filled with discs and no player has connected four in a row, the game ends in a draw.</p>
    
  <p>7. Restarting the Game: After the game ends (either by a win or a draw), players have the option to restart the game and play again.</p>
    
  <p>These are the fundamental rules of Connect Four. Players must strategically place their discs to block their opponent's moves while aiming to connect their own discs in a winning pattern.</p>
